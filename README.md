## Requirements (IMPORTANT)
You need to have all of these to make it work.
<ol>
<li>Stonk Pickaxe for mining the cobble</li>
<li>Silverfish Pet or God Potion, since you need Haste 3 to insta-mine cobble.</li>
<i>Note that god potions expire, if your expires while mining you won't be able to mine any cobble.</i>
<li>Personal Compactor with Enchanted Cobblestone inside to automate the crafting process.</li>
<li>Large Enchanted Mining Sack, so you can store the enchanted cobble.</li>
<li>Booster Cookie to access /bz for selling enchanted cobble.</li>
</ol>


## How to use
<ol>
<li>Log in Hypixel and navigate to the Skyblock gamemode.</li>
<li>Position your character in a spot where it can mine cobblestone.</li>
<li>Once positioned, open the program and after 5 seconds the bot will take control.</li>
<li>Press the "Z" key on your keyboard to stop the bot.</li>
</ol>


## How to make as much profit as possible
Here are some tips to increase your profits
<ol>
<li>Since Mining Fortune now affects Cobblestone, getting as much as possible will increase the number of cobble drops per block.</li>
<li>Speed, you can insta-mine cobble, so the faster you go the more cobble you will mine per hour.</li>
<li>Compact Enchant, maxed in 1 million mined cobble it has 0.6% chance to drop enchanted cobble when mining regular cobble.</li>
<li>Reforge Stonk to Unyielding for +4 mining fortune and enchant with Fortune 3 for more mining fortune.</li>
<li>If you are using God Potion, then you can equip a pet for more Mining Fortune. (Don't do it if you dont have god pot since you can't inst-mine.. Stick to Silverfish)</li>
<li>Don't forget about HOTM perks. You can not only get more fortune but also Efficiant Miner perk on HOTM Tier 4 which allows you to mine multiple ores at once, and for cobble counts toward ores for some reason.</li>
</ol>
